1. Well done.
1. When vectorizing, make sure that operations are not already vectorized. Manually vectorizing an already vectorized function will make it slower. (All basic operations and functions in np should already be vectorized.)
1. Make sure that you activate Travis-ci for your repository, and have it autorun on at least one push to make sure your tests pass.
